# Bank Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective

The aim of this project is to develop and implement a predictive model to identify customers who are at risk of leaving the bank (churning). The insights gained from the model will enable the bank to proactively take measures to retain these customers, thereby reducing churn rates and improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Data Source

The data for this project is sourced from the bankâ€™s historical customer records, including:

- **Customer demographics:** Age, gender, marital status, etc.
- **Account information:** Account balance, account type, tenure, etc.
- **Transaction history:** Frequency, amount, and types of transactions.
- **Service usage:** Use of banking services like loans, credit cards, etc.
- **Customer feedback:** Satisfaction ratings, complaints, and service requests.
- **Churn history:** Data on past customers who have left the bank.

Additionally, external data sources such as economic indicators, market trends, and social media sentiment may be integrated to enhance the predictive power of the model.

## Explanation

This project involves developing a predictive model for bank customer churn. By identifying at-risk customers, the bank can take proactive measures to retain them. The project will include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and training, and performance evaluation. The ultimate goal is to deploy a model that accurately predicts customer churn, helping the bank implement effective retention strategies and improve overall customer satisfaction.
